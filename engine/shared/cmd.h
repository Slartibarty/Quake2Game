// Command buffer
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*

Any number of commands can be added in a frame, from several different sources.
Most commands come from either keybindings or console line input, but remote
servers can also send across commands and entire text files can be execed.

The + command line options are also added to the command buffer.

The game starts with a Cbuf_AddText ("exec quake.rc\n"); Cbuf_Execute ();

*/

#define	EXEC_NOW	0		// don't return until completed
#define	EXEC_INSERT	1		// insert at current position, but don't run yet
#define	EXEC_APPEND	2		// add to end of the command buffer

void Cbuf_Init( void );
// allocates an initial text buffer that will grow as needed

void Cbuf_AddText( const char *text );
// as new commands are generated from the console or keybindings,
// the text is added to the end of the command buffer.

void Cbuf_InsertText( const char *text );
// when a command wants to issue other commands immediately, the text is
// inserted at the beginning of the buffer, before any remaining unexecuted
// commands.

void Cbuf_ExecuteText( int exec_when, char *text );
// this can be used in place of either Cbuf_AddText or Cbuf_InsertText

void Cbuf_AddEarlyCommands( bool clear );
// adds all the +set commands from the command line

bool Cbuf_AddLateCommands( void );
// adds all the remaining + commands from the command line
// Returns true if any late commands were added, which
// will keep the demoloop from immediately starting

void Cbuf_Execute( void );
// Pulls off \n terminated lines of text from the command buffer and sends
// them through Cmd_ExecuteString.  Stops when the buffer is empty.
// Normally called once per frame, but may be explicitly invoked.
// Do not call inside a command function!

void Cbuf_CopyToDefer( void );
void Cbuf_InsertFromDefer( void );
// These two functions are used to defer any pending commands while a map
// is being loaded

/*

Command execution takes a null terminated string, breaks it into tokens,
then searches for a command or variable that matches the first token.

// if function is NULL, the command will be forwarded to the server
// as a clc_stringcmd instead of executed locally

// The functions that execute commands get their parameters with these
// functions. Cmd_Argv () will return an empty string, not a NULL
// if arg > argc, so string operations are always safe.

void	Cmd_TokenizeString( char *text, bool macroExpand );
// Takes a null terminated string.  Does not need to be /n terminated.
// breaks the string up into arg tokens.

void	Cmd_ExecuteString( char *text );
// Parses a single line of text into arguments and tries to execute it
// as if it was typed at the console

void	Cmd_ForwardToServer( void );
// adds the current command line as a clc_stringcmd to the client message.
// things like godmode, noclip, etc, are commands directed to the server,
// so when they are typed in at the console, they will need to be forwarded.
